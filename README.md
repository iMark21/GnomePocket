# GnomePocket

This is one of these times, our heroes just arrived at a Gnome town called Brastlewark. To facilitate trade with the local population they need an easy way to browse all the inhabitants details. We've found a server providing all the census data of Brastlewark at the following address:

Gnomes in this town are not really social because they have too much work to do. That's the reason they can have more than one job and might have few or even no friends at all. They also appreciate their privacy so they've used some random images from internet, not specifically optimized for mobile devices, for their profile. (They are very modern in some aspects and they have smartphones and access to internet for instance).
 
Please write an Android / iOS / AngularJS application to help our team browse and be able to see the details of those inhabitants.
